- Strategic Decision: The company increased bidding for desktop devices to maximize ROI.

### 2. Website Performance & A/B Testing

- Bounce Rate Analysis: The initial homepage had a high bounce rate of nearly 60%.
- Lander Test: A/B testing results showed that /lander-1 outperformed the original /home with a lower bounce rate.

### 3. Product & User Analysis

- Launch Effect: The launch of a second product in January 2013 successfully increased overall monthly sales volume.
